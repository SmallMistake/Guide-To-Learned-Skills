3) Python Intro to Machine Learning
   -) This is a collection of projects I created while following along with the textbook "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensor Flow
      * Python
      * Tensorflow
      * Neural Networks
      * Reinforcement Learning

4) MineRL
   -) This repository contains the code used in an Artificial Intelegence building contest I competed in. The goal was to build an AI that could beat Minecraft with no outside assistance. I used this opportunity to apply what I had learned, and I created an AI that could navigate and mine for wood using a reinforcment learning alogrithm. 
   * Python
   * Tensorflow
   * Neural Networks
   * Reinforcement Learning

5) Python Exercises

6) Blender Sketch A Day
    -) A collection of seven 3d models I created over the course of a week. By doing this, I acquired a vary basic ability to use 3d modeling software.
