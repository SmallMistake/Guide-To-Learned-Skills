4) MineRL <br/>
   -) This repository contains the code used in an Artificial Intelegence building contest I competed in. The goal was to build an AI that could beat Minecraft with no outside assistance. I used this opportunity to apply what I had learned, and I created an AI that could navigate and mine for wood using a reinforcment learning alogrithm. 
      * Python
